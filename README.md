## Analyze A/B Test Results

You may either submit your notebook through the workspace here, or you may work from your local machine and submit through the next page.  Either way assure that your code passes the project [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).  **Please save regularly.**

This project will assure you have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics lessons.  The hope is to have this project be as comprehensive of these topics as possible.  Good luck!

### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**As you work through this notebook, follow along in the classroom and answer the corresponding quiz questions associated with each question.** The labels for each classroom concept are provided for each question.  This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).

#### Part I - Probability

To get started, let's import our libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
#We are setting the seed to assure you get the same answers on quizzes as we set up
random.seed(42)
```

`1.` Now, read in the `ab_data.csv` data. Store it in `df`.  **Use your dataframe to answer the questions in Quiz 1 of the classroom.**

a. Read in the dataset and take a look at the top few rows here:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('ab_data.csv')
```
b. Use the cell below to find the number of rows in the dataset.
